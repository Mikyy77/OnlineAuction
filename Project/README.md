Real estate auction

My goal is to create an application for a real estate auction. Users will be able to bid for houses as much as they like. The process will work like a basic English auction.

People will be able to offer their properties for an initial price. When the auction starts, everyone can bid. The person who offers their property can choose the duration of the auction, which will last max. 3 days. The auctions will be public, free for everyone to join. The auction system will take a 2% fee for realising the auction process. Each user will have enough money to buy houses by default and they can earn more by offering their properties to the auction.

The process will be simulated and the real estate properties created at random, chosen from a list of many famous buildings. There will be a minimum offering price for each auction process.
